🔍 Analytical Tasks Performed

A total of 20 structured analytical questions were solved across 6 Sections:

1️⃣ Section 1: Data Understanding & Cleaning (Pandas + NumPy)

2️⃣ Section 2: Sales & Revenue Analysis (Pandas)

3️⃣ Section 3: NumPy-based Insights

4️⃣ Section 4: Time-Based Analysis (Pandas)

5️⃣ Section 5: Matplotlib Visualizations

6️⃣ Section 6: Seaborn Visual Analytics


📊 Data Visualization

Visualizations were created to support business storytelling and insight communication, including:

Bar charts for category-wise revenue comparison

Line plots for sales trends over time

Histograms for transaction distribution analysis

Count plots for payment method usage

Scatter plots for price vs quantity relationships

Correlation heatmaps for numerical features

📈 Key Insights

A small number of categories generate a large share of total revenue

Customer spending is unevenly distributed, with high-value customers driving sales

Discounted transactions show distinct purchasing behavior

Sales trends indicate seasonality and growth patterns

Strong correlations exist between quantity sold, price, and total sales
